welcome to Bonkers in linear combinations what's the definition of a column vector and international calling Vector ex is in order list of an real numbers which we do no fault  noticed that in the typeset nodes we have the advantage of being able to use both face to differentiate a column Vector EX  now since we can't use both face when we had right out problems we are going to instead use a notation x with an arrow over the top of it to do know a call him back when we ride it out  next episode of all international calling their actors with real number and Therese is denoted RN  and the real number or scalar X I just called the ice component or row of the bacharach's and finally to backers X and Y and R and R equal if XYZ all I want to end  let's look at some examples  so for example given to call vectors in our for notice that in this case we just wrote the word Vector here instead of column Vector so on this course the word vector by itself will always mean column vector  the two factors are calling doctors X Y and R for Emily want to do is figure out X to now X2 is the second component or the second act which in this case is to  and why some three is the third component or the third row of why which in this case is -2  let's move on example to the first factor is in R2  and the second doctor is in R3  not going back the definition it says two factors x y and r n r equal if they have the same all the same components  but a bacharach's in our two in another Vector less A Y and R three are not comparable because they have different dimensions one of the two dimensional larger than the other so the answer to this question is no  sent the given vectors  have different  the mansions  in this case one of the factors is two-dimensional and the other factor is 3 to match  example 3 a bit of notation here we're going to use the vector zero to denote the vector that has entry equal to 0 4 all roads are all components  now let's move on to some operations that we can form on backers the first one is called back to Edition so if I have two factors X Y and R and I want to add them up then x + y we do the addition component by component  so for example the first component of x + y would be the first component of x + the first component of Y and song  next up we have what's called a scalar multiplication  you're taking a scale RC or real number see you're multiplying by a vector ex and again this operation is performed component by component or row by row so for example the first component of c x x we just take CD times the first component of X and saw down a lot  lastly let's talk about this idea of a linear combination of two factors X and Y so given scalars S&T the linear combination s x plus he was born first offer going to take the back of Action X the scalar SX then we're going to take the vector y x the scale or two to get the doctor and then we're going to add up those two doctors ice x and t y to get the money or combination s x + t y  let's move onto example for a given 2 backwards X Y and R 3 they want to simplify the following linear combination  the first off 3x - 4y looks like we're taking 3x and subtracting off why we can think of that as a linear combination 3x + -1 * wall  it's over going to do first is take three times the vector ex and we're just doing scalar multiplication here so 3 times of bacharach's * 3 * the first component of Aksum get 3 multiply 3 by the second component of Acts and get negative 3 and finally multiply 3 by the third component of Acts to get sex  we're going to add that to the scalar multiple -1 * y now we're going to take the components of Y and X Mall my -1 + -3 + 3 + -6  and then to form a linear combination we're going to add these two vectors up  and we will get for the first component 3 - 320 + -3 + 3 + 0 + 6 - 6 + 0 which in the final answer then will just be the three dimensional zero Factor  what's next look at their own one which in the pool book is called Darren 1.1 so here we have three backers XYZ an RN into scalars S&T we have the properties of these operations that we defined so the first one says x + y is equal to y + x so what this says is that vector addition  vector addition is commutative  so this is called the commutative property of vector addition  second property says that we could either take x + y first and then add the result is he or we can take y + z force and then add tax to that and get the same thing this property is called associative property or associative and so this property is saying the vector addition is associative  next up property 3 says that the zero Vector axes and additive identity meaning that x + 0 is always equal just acts so we can summarize this property by saying 0 is an additive identity  property for says in any bacharach's has what's called an additive inverse not an additive inverse Negative X  in our case just going to be the scaler -1 * X will be are out of the Denver's  + x + the additive inverse of X is equal to 0 so I can always take any bacharach's inform the additive inverse such the two add up to zero  this is a quick example that if x is equal to 1/2  in the additive inverse of X would be the backer negative one negative to in a season to check if I had those two backers off I get to zero BAC  properties five and six are important properties and they're typically called distributive laws so as x x + y is s x + S + t x axis the same thing as a sex plus TX  and then finally 7 says if I take two scalars s t it it's going to give me the same thing in my first x x x t and then take the resultant Vector ex is going to be the same as taking a shower as times of actor cheat on Jax and then finally descaler 1 * X is always equal to X  these eight properties that are end and then in the operation that we Define on RN  combined to say I told Aaron want the eight different coffees combined to say the RN  it is what's called a vector  space  Vector space is a set of actors and with the sun to find operation that satisfy these eight properties and so are NYC Aaron Wan does a vector space so we're not going to prove every single one of these properties for operations but let's just look at 1 so we're going to justify part 5 of dinner and we're only going to do it in our to look at property five more carefully and see if we can justify that in our to use the definition of vector addition and scalar multiplication  price we want to show that ass x x + y is the same thing as a tax plus sy so let's start over here on the left with s x x + 1  are we going to show this in artuso axes of Akron are two  let's write that out and why it's also background or to its white out its components  I know it's hard to simplify this and see if we can get to the right side of our equality  I hope the doctors axonal loss while I wan  X2 + Y2  play some now I'm just taking this new backer and i x s x that doctor something a scalar multiplication here and again by definition of scalar multiplication perform component by component  forget the scalar s x the first component  IMAX + y in the scalar ass X II of x + y  and now everything inside here in the first opponent I said this doctor is a real number  everything II to Poland is a real number and so we know these distributive laws hold for real numbers and so we can write this Factor as sx1  Plus s y one and then s x 2 + s y 2  but that's the same thing as the vector sx1 sx2  plus the vector Sy 1sy to  now I can pull the ass out of the first backer to get s x the doctor X  and I can pull out s from the second doctor as well to get asked on the back door want  so just using the definitions of vector addition and scalar multiplication as well as distributive properties for real numbers we are able to show that f x x + y is the same thing as asked on Jack's plus as x y and this the end justifies part 5 of theorem 1 in or two
